# DETR
Final Project for Deep Learning Course

This is a very rough model of using a HuggingFace Transformer (DETR) from Facebook to predict the Object Detection from a Kitti Dataset. The model includes a training and validaiton sections. The model includes multiple metrics such as accuracy, cross entropy loss, giou and iou. This model can be improved by creating helper functions and classes, which is a possible project in the future. There is an ouput of an image with an attempt to create a bounding box from the prediction. 

Need to upload the 2d Object Detection Dataset from the Kitti site. This will work with the code. Only the training dataset was used for this experimentation.
